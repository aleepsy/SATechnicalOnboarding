Hello, this is Alejandra Pérez from México.

I'm a Computer Engineering Student @ UAM Azcapotzalco.

Member and Founder of X-Women team and community that wants to empower women in tech.

This is the technical Onboarding Process - MLSA to get the BETA milestone.

I used my Azure Suscription, Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop to create a web page with my information.
